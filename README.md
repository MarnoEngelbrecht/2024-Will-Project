Going trough the code you will see that I created a Python API that saves data on an Access Database.
Property Listings Website
This project is a dynamic property listings website built using a Python API backend with data stored in an Access database. The backend handles requests, retrieves and displays listings dynamically, and uses JWT-based password hashing for secure user authentication.
This was my WILL Project for 2024. 

Project Features

Python API Backend: Serves data to the frontend and handles user authentication.
Access Database: Stores all property listings, user data, and encrypted passwords.
JWT Auth Password Hashing: Provides secure password storage and authentication.
Dynamic Content Loading: Content is dynamically fetched and displayed.

Here you can see what the website looks like.
Note: The version hosted on GitHub Pages is a static site, meaning it doesnâ€™t include backend functionality (like dynamic content loading or JWT authentication).
